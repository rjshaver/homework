				<p>My Background is in Chemistry and I have a Bachelor's and a Master's Degree from many years ago.</p>
				<p>After spending many years doing research with heavy metals or testing urine samples, I had to make a change so I have been studying web design.  I have so many interests that I cannot name them all, but to start a few are gardening, electronics, computers and operating systems, Of course, I enjoy gaming and programming.  A more recent interest is related to improving my health and has forced me to start exercising at the YMCA regularly.  From many years in the laboratory, I could not continue living a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
